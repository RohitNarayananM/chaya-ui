### Colors

Always use colors from the `emotion-js` theme context either from styled components or via useTheme().

There is an attribute `isDarkTheme` available in theme properties, which can be used to determine whether
the component will be shown to a dark or light theme.

Don't color unnecessarily.

### Font Sizes

To provide font-sizes to various elements & components, always use tailwind classes.

A good choice for most places would be `text-lg`.

Strictly do not use manually defined font-sizes (be it in `rem`, `vh/vw`, `calc()`, or `px` forms).

### User Input Components

Any user input component must have the following props
   - `value` - the value of the input
   - `onChange: (value) => void` - a callback function that gives the new value when changed
   - `required`  - boolean, whether the field input is required for form submission. Default to `false`
   - `disabled`  - boolean, disables user interaction but whatever pre-existing values exist can remain. Default to `false`

Optionally, these can have
   - `autoFocus` - boolean, whether the input should be focused on load. Default to `false`
   - `invalid` - to mark when the input given by the user is invalid. Usually outline the input with red color when this is set.
   -  `type` - when a variety of types of input are accepted by a field, this can be used to restrict it to specific type.

Input components should support a `labels` props, which can have the following props
   - `label` - the label of the input
   -  `placeholder` - a placeholder text for the input

Kindly, do not directly add `label` & `placeholder` as props to the input component.
