# Traboda Design System

Traboda Design System is a collection of reusable components, and other frontend utility functions for React, that are 
used to design a consistent, modern and accessible frontend for Traboda platforms.

While this project is various platforms of Traboda in production, it is still in its early stages and 
the component props and apis are subject to change.

## Usage

Install the package by running - 
```bash
npm install @traboda/design-system
```
or with yarn, as 
```bash
yarn add @traboda/design-system
```

## Development Guide

The recommended workflow is to run TSDX in one terminal:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

Run inside another terminal run the storybook to see the components in action.

```bash
yarn storybook
```

This loads the stories from `./stories`.
